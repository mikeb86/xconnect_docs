# xConnect Remote Management Platform

xConnect Remote Management Platform is the latest enhancement to the already impressive Seneca Physical Security line of products. xConnect allows you to audit, manage, and maintain all aspects of a security installation. From camera function to storage integrity, xConnect puts you in control of your entire environment from a single, intuitive dashboard.

xConnect monitors your security environment with advanced intelligence, and empowers you to manage and maintain many functions of your installation from a single web-based user interface. While its functionality may be expected to center around the performance monitoring of network video recorders, the application also provides command and control functionality on the device level.

This platform is designed with managed service providers in mind to enable intuitive, but powerful, enterprise level management of one or many security networks through a single pane of glass. Reduce the amount of service calls and truck rolls by getting in front of issues before your end-user realizes that something has happened.
