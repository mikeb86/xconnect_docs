The background services may fail to install if the installer is not ran with elevated privileges! Windows Service The Server Agent consists of a single background Windows Service, the xConnect Agent Core . The Agent Core service is responsible for the following functions and modules: Telemetry Engine This function is the telemetry collection engine that continuously polls various sensors throughout the system. It is also responsible for transmitting this telemetry to the Secure Gateway. Telemetry Collection and Submission occurs every 2 minutes (every even minute). VMS Integration Module This module is the telemetry collection engine that continuously polls supported Video Management Systems for health and meta data of connected IP cameras. It is also responsible for transmitting this telemetry to the Secure Gateway. Telemetry Collection and Submission occurs every 2 minutes (every odd minute). Auto-Updater Module This module handles touchless over the wire updates of the Server Agent. An update package can be delivered to the Secure Gateway, and the Server Agent will automatically download and install this update unattended. Checks for updates every 5 minutes Agent Web Interface This module provides a local (or LAN accessible) web interface for managing and configuring the Server Agent. Starts Automatically as part of the Agent Core and is accessible from the local machine @ http://localhost:8885 or on a networked machine @ http://IP_OF_SERVER:8885 Note This web interface is required to enable Cloud support and configuration of the gateway connection! Remote Command Module This module handles remote commands that are securely received through the gateway. It is responsible for executing and tracking status of remotely triggered commands.

This is a physical hardware device provided by Arrow that has our hardened system image and most configuration details already pre-configured from our factory. The physical gateway highlighted in this guide is an ultra-small form factor embedded PC provided by Arrow. The specifications of this physical gateway are: SYSTEM Manufacturer Seneca\u00ae Operating System Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Server Memory 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz Processor Intel\u00ae Celeron\u00ae N3060 1.6-2.48Ghz 2MB Cache USB 4x USB3.0 (Front), 1x USB2.0 (Front), 2x Micro USB 2.0 (Side) Physical Security 1x Kensington Lock Warranty 3 and 5 Year Warranty Options Available MECHANICALS Thermals 0\u00baC to 35\u00baC / 32\u00baF to 95\u00baF Power Draw 15W Cooling Aluminum Extrusion Chassis Heatsink Mounting VESA/Wall Mountable, Brackets included, Rack shelf available for purchase Dimensions (w x h x d) 7.5 x 1.75 x 4.25 inches / 191 x 46 x 108 millimeters Weight 3 lbs. / 1.4 kg Onboarding/Installation instructions are available in the \"Getting Started\" chapter. Virtual Machine Gateway Option The virtual gateway option is available when using existing infrastructure to host the Secure Gateway is desired. A Hyper-V Virtual Disk or VMWare OVA can be provided upon request and needs to be imported into the appropriate hypervisor. Note It is recommended to have 2 virtual switches attached to the VM. 1 Virtual Switch with connectivity to your internal LAN assets, and 1 Virtual Switch with Internet connectivity. Professional Services are available to assist in importing and configuration of the virtual Secure Gateway. Onboarding/Installation instructions are available in the \"Getting Started\" chapter. Docker Container We now support deploying a \"bare minimum\" Gateway image via Docker. This option allows you to have an xConnect Secure Gateway deployed in minutes, granted you can supply a machine that Docker can be installed on. As of this writing, you can use any Linux OS of your choosing to deploy the xConnect Gateway software with Docker. Container installation instruction files are available on our github page: https://github.com/senecaxconnect/xconnect_gateway_docker Note Docker for Windows will not be officially supported until WSL2 is publicly available. However, you could install a Linux OS within a Hyper-V VM on Windows and it would be fully supported. Note Certain features (Remote Desktop Pass-through and Seneca Remote Support Services) will NOT be available (without Seneca consultation) when using the Docker gateway: Installation instructions are also available in the \"Getting Started\" chapter. Secure Gateway Services The xConnect Secure Gateway is a device, or virtual machine, that runs a customized and hardened Ubuntu Server system image. Within this image are several key services: Arrow Connect Gateway Engine This service is the main data consumption and transmission engine responsible for ingesting telemetry from all Server Agents and transmitting telemetry to Arrow Connect IoT. Arrow Connect IoT provides telemetry to the Web Client Dashboard through secure APIs. Gateway Configuration Manager This is a built-in local (or LAN accessible) web interface for configuration all relevant features to the xConnect Remote Management Platform. Note Not available with Docker container Remote Desktop Gateway This is a service that provides client-less remote desktop connections from the Web Client Dashboard through to the Server Agent system. At time of this publication, RDP is the only protocol supported. Note Not available with Docker container Secure Tunnel Service This service provides secure HTTP and TCP tunnels to and from the Web Client Dashboard and the private network being managed. All connections are encrypted web sockets through port 443 (HTTPS). Note Not available with Docker container Network Requirements The xConnect Secure Gateway requires very minimal network configuration or firewall rules to be fully functional. Some common industry standard ports that are required to be open are: Agent \u2192 Gateway Access Requirement This is typically on your LAN so access rules are rarely required unless running on a hardened network. In the case of internal LAN traffic being managed, verify the following access is granted between the hosts (Agents) and the Gateway asset - Port 8080 (TCP/HTTP) - Port 1883 (TCP/MQTT) Gateway \u2192 Cloud Access Requirement Microsoft Azure access is bare minimum required: - Destination IPs will vary based on region and load-balancing so a hostname based rule is preferred. - A wildcard access rule for outbound traffic to .senecaxconnect.com is the safest bet to future proof your firewall rules. - Outbound TCP traffic via **Port 443* to .senecaxconnect.com - Outbound TCP traffic via **Port 8883* to .senecaxconnect.com - **No inbound rules required* Amazon EC2 access is optional but is highly recommend and required for the following features to function: - Seneca\u2019s administrative interface to connect to your gateway to push updates - Server Agent OTA updates - General support/troubleshooting of your gateway - Secure Remote Desktop Passthrough - If you wish to opt-in to these features and enable our team to continually support your platform, please whitelist Outbound TCP 443 to ***.ngrok.io** and ***.ngrok.com**.
