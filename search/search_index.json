From camera function to storage integrity, xConnect puts you in control of your entire environment from a single, intuitive dashboard. xConnect monitors your security environment with advanced intelligence, and empowers you to manage and maintain many functions of your installation from a single web-based user interface. While its functionality may be expected to center around the performance monitoring of network video recorders, the application also provides command and control functionality on the device level. This platform is designed with managed service providers in mind to enable intuitive, but powerful, enterprise level management of one or many security networks through a single pane of glass.

We will explain how to install the xConnect Server Agent on existing servers, and how to configure it once installed. If purchasing a new server from Seneca, the installation process is not necessary, and you can jump straight to the configuration step. However, it is recommended to always grab the latest version from our download repository Once the xConnect Server Agents are installed and configured, your next step is to configure your xConnect Secure Gateway. The Secure Gateway is responsible for providing a seamless encrypted tunnel between Server Agents and the xConnect Web Client Dashboard. The xConnect Agent resides locally on network servers discovering network devices and applications interfacing with a secure gateway device. The xConnect Gateway sends real-time data to the xConnect web interface, providing system and device information. In the event of an issue, xConnect can trigger a workflow to immediately notify or react to an issue in the environment. xConnect Server Agent This is a required component for any server that you would like to be monitored by the xConnect Platform.

This physical or virtual gateway is responsible for being the encrypted tunnel between the Server Agents and the Web Client Dashboard. There are multiple deployment options for this Secure Gateway: Turnkey : This is a hardware appliance sold by Seneca and is pre-configured with Virtual Machine : Virtual machines can be configured by Seneca to match the features and functionality of our Turnkey appliance with the purchase of professional services. Docker Container : This is a container image (available on Docker Hub) of the xConnect Gateway software that can onboard a gateway in minutes with minimal configuration. Some features (ie.
